# Adversarial-Learning

## Introduction
Welcome to our GitHub repository exploring the intersection of adversarial learning and Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. Adversarial learning, characterized by the interplay between a "generator" and a "discriminator" neural network, has shown promise in generating realistic data and improving model robustness. In this project, we delve into the application of adversarial learning specifically in the context of NER, a crucial task involving the identification of named entities in unstructured text data. By employing adversarial learning, we aim to enhance the performance of NER models, shedding light on how this framework can effectively address challenges in recognizing entities such as persons, locations, and organizations within diverse textual sources like news articles and social media. Join us in exploring novel approaches and contributing to the advancement of adversarial learning in NER.
